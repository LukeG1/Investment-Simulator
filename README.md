# Goals

The objective with this codebase is to asses household investment strategies in their statistical context, that means instead simply using a mean return for a given investment type like an online calculator would. Here I will use Monte Carlo Simulation to give a distribution of results for any 'query', this opens up the opportunity to look not at average returns, but instead $P(balance â‰¤ 0)$ (hereby refered to as PPF) over an entire lifetime of investing, and see how likley a person is to run out of money in their retirement, which can then be minimized against when choosing a strategy.

The reason for approaching the problem like this is two fold:

1. I have a suspicion that many people are undervaluing the risk that comes with high volatility, I have heard reccomended that you shouldn't even consider bonds in your 20s and 30s, but I question if that volatility that introduces is woth the inarguably higher mean value. Again, for the vast majority of people minimizing PPF at expected life expectancy should be their highest priority, even if that means accepting some fraction of the mean value of your portfolio at that time
2. I don't think investment advice is individualized enough, even if you hired a personal financial advisor they aren't running these simulations, they are using the known reccomendations, but with this system, you could brute force a strategy for anyone in any finanical situation that gives them the best chance

# Implementation

## Data Aggregation

The dificulty with simulating something over such a long term as a person's life is the quantity of data, you need a huge number of samples to get an accurate idea of the values 80 some years later with any ammount of detirminisim, This led me to store anything that I would need to track a balance of as a discrete distribution of outcomes, which I can take a snapshot of at the end of every year, meaning I only need to store one of these for every balance, instead of for every balance for every year, or frame the data around a simulation and store millions of those. This also allows me to implement parreleization at the simplest level, things like adding 2 of these distributions together, or multiplying by a return, which adds some overhead for spawining workers to do so, but simplfiies the development significantly
